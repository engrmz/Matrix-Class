Thanks to @Davide Faconti (facontidavide) for his guidance.





Instructions:
============
No pointers are used, which reduces errors possibility due to dangling pointers or memory leaks. On backend, complete implementation is in 1D. However, to user it looks like a 2D matrix. Therefore it is a memory efficient implementation that take real scenarios into account. 

Details: 
=======
The Matrix class has been created using C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. Please download complete repository for test. The file matrix.h can be utilized as a source code (matrix library). It can help is finding the followings;

1. Inverse of a matrix
2. Determinant of a Matrix
3. Minor of a matrix
4. Transpose of a matrix
5. Matrix multiplication

Remaining functionalities will be added soon. 

How to run?
----------
1. You can open the file "Matrix Library.sln" in Visual Studio project. It will show two files "Matrix.h" and "main.cpp". Write a code in main.cpp and call functions provided in Matrix.h.

2. Copy "Matrix.h" into your directory. Include the header file "Matrix.h" and use the member functions.

@ Ubuntu:
========
The code can be used in Ubuntu environment using G++. The Valgrind can help in checking memory leaks. See the link for Valgrind help in Ubuntu environment.
